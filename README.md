# Work Log Tracker and Management Portal Android App

## App Specifications

- User must be able to create an account and log in. (If a mobile application, this means that more users can use the app from the same phone).
- User can add (and edit and delete) a row describing what they have worked on, what date, and for how long.
- User can add a setting (Preferred working hours per day).
- If on a particular date a user has worked under theÂ PreferredWorkingHourPerDay, these rows are red, otherwise green.
- Implement at least **three roles** with different permission levels: a **regular** user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user **manager** would be able to CRUD users, and an **admin** would be able to CRUD all records and users.
- Filter entries by date from-to.
- Export the filtered times to a sheet in HTML:
	- Date: 2018.05.21
	- Total time: 9h
	- Notes: Notes

	
## Code Architecutre
The app is written purely in **Kotlin** and uses MVVM to keep responsibilities separate and keep UI as dum as possible.

![architecture](docs/app-architecture.png)

 App is divided into 3 layers.
 
 1. **UI/View** (shows UI with the provided data without any kind of processing)
 2. **Presentation** (Gathers and prepares data for presentation and then forwards it to UI)
 3. **Domain** (remote and local sync, other domain logic)
 4. **Data** (fetching of data and other pure data related manipulation)

### Other Technical Details

- **Kolin Coroutines and Flow** has been used for asynchronous logic.
- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android), written on top of Dagger2, by Google, now officially recommend library by Google, has been used for Dependency Injection.
- **Android JetPack** set of libraries is fully utilized.
- RecyclerView has been used for showing list of items.
- CardView has been used for showing cards in the list.
- ConstraintLayout has been used for efficient layouts.
- Material Design Theme has been used in the app to take advantage of the material design components.
- All strings are translatable and no string is hard coded.
- All colors are themable and now color has been hard coded.

## Backend

- **Firebase** is used for all backend handling.
- Functionality like user creation, update, delete is not possible with Firebase client SDK so cloud functions have to been written in **Type Script** and deployed as Google Cloud Functions. Those functions setup can be found in **backend** folder in the project.

## Admin

An admin can create/edit/delete users/managers same as manager so that flow is completely same. Settings are also same as Manager. The extra stuff that an admin can do includes
- See and Create Admin
- Access each user's work logs and create/edit/delete those logs along with filtering and export of those filtered logs
